# User Story: Add ability to add a todo

```
As a user
I want to be able to add a TODO item
so I can track the things I want to do.
```

## Plan

- Understand what is currently happening in the code ✅
- Add a test for adding a todo ✅
- Add a post route to allow a todo to be added to memory ✅
- Add a form on the front-end to allow a user to input their todo item
- Link front-end form to back end to allow a new todo to be added
- Add some better styling to the front-end

### If time

- Add persistent storage
- Add error handling
